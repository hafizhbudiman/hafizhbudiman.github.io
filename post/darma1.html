                 Imagine that you are an analyst with an investment firm that tracks airline stocks. You’re given the task of determining
                the relationship (if any) between airline announcements of fare increases and the behavior of their stocks the next day.
                Historical data about stock prices is easy to come by, but what about the airline announcements? You will need to know at
                least the name of the airline, the nature of the proposed fare hike, the dates of the announcement, and possibly the response
                of other airlines. Fortunately, these can be all found in news articles like this one:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                     Citing high fuel prices, United Airlines said Friday it has increased fares by $6 per round trip on flights to some cities
                    also served by lowercost carriers. American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., immediately matched the move, spokesman Tim Wagner
                    said. United, a unit of UAL Corp., said the increase took effect Thursday and applies to most routes where it competes against
                    discount carriers, such as Chicago to Dallas and Denver to San Francisco.
                </ul>

            <h3 style="text-align: center">What is Information Extraction?</h3>
            <p>
                 Information extraction is the process of extracting specific (pre-specified) information from textual sources. One of the
                most trivial examples is when your email extracts only the data from the message for you to add in your Calendar. Other free-flowing
                textual sources from which information extraction can distill structured information are legal acts, medical records, social
                media interactions and streams, online news, government documents, corporate reports and more. Gathering detailed structured
                data from texts, information extraction enables:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The automation of tasks such as smart content classification, integrated search, management and delivery
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data-driven activities such as mining for patterns and trends, uncovering hidden relationships, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center">Typical Applications of Information Extraction</h3>
            <p>
                 Information extraction can be applied to a wide range of textual sources: from emails and Web pages to reports, presentations,
                legal documents and scientific papers. The technology successfully solves challenges related to content management and knowledge
                discovery in the areas of:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Business intelligence (for enabling analysts to gather structured information from multiple sources)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Financial investigation (for analysis and discovery of hidden relationships)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scientific research (for automated references discovery or relevant papers suggestion)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Media monitoring (for mentions of companies, brands, people)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Healthcare records management (for structuring and summarizing patients records)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pharma research (for drug discovery, adverse effects discovery and clinical trials automated analysis)
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h3 style="text-align: center">Current Trends, Challenges and the Future of Information Extraction</h3>
            <p>
                 For over a decade the bulk of research focused on information extraction in English. The growing amount of textual data
                available in other languages resulted in shifting of the focus to other non-English IE and language-independent (multilingual)
                IE techniques.While much of the attention in non-English IE focused on NER (which includes a collection of references
                to work on non-English NER), relatively little work has been reported on higher-level IE tasks, including relation and event
                extraction. IE in languages other than English is, in general, harder, and the performance of non-English IE systems is usually
                lower. This is mainly due to lack of core NLP components and underlying linguistic resources for many languages, but most
                of all due to the various linguistic phenomena that are non-existent in English, which include, inter alia:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Lack of whitespace, which complicates word boundary disambiguation (e.g., in Chinese Mandarin)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Productive compounding, which complicates morphological analysis, as in German, where circa 10–15% words are compounds whose
                        decomposition is crucial for higher-level NLP processing, Finnic languages exhibit similar phenomena.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Complex proper name declension, which complicates named-entity normalisation. Typical for Slavic languages and exemplified
                        in, which describes techniques for lemmatisation and matching Polish person names.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Zero anaphora, whose resolution is crucial in the context of CO task. This is typical for Japanese, Romance and Slavic languages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Free word order and rich morphology, which complicates relation extraction. This is typical, e.g., for Germanic, Slavic and
                        Romance languages, and exemplified in, which proposes more linguistically sophisticated extraction patterns for relation
                        extraction than the classical surface-level linear extraction patterns applied in many English IE systems.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                 Apart from tackling multi-linguality, one central characteristic theme that runs through current research in IE, as distinguished
                from classic IE presented so far, is the extraction of information from multiple sources—in contrast from finding information
                within a single piece of text. The clear motivation for this is that most given facts or stories typically do not exist in
                an isolated report, but are rather carried by many on-line sources, possibly in different languages. In particular, the information
                redundancy resulting from the access to multiple sources reporting can be exploited for the validation of facts. Further,
                the fact or story may undergo evolution through time, with elaborations, modifications, or possibly even contradictory related
                information emerging over time.
